# Proactive remediation: Monitor Additional LSA Protection

The LSA, which includes the Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) process, validates users for local and remote sign-ins and enforces local security policies.

The LSA, which includes the Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) process, validates users for local and remote sign-ins and enforces local security policies. The Windows operating system provides additional protection for the LSA to prevent reading memory and code injection by non-protected processes. 

This provides added security for the credentials that the LSA stores and manages. When this setting is used in conjunction with Secure Boot, additional protection is achieved as disabling the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa registry post configuration key has no effect.

The scripts will monitor and remidate the following registry value:

- HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\RunAsPPL, to the following REG_DWORD value: 1
- HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\DisableDomainCreds, to the following REG_DWORD value: 1
